abstract: >-
  YAMS (Yet Another Memory System) is an open-source hybrid retrieval system
  combining SQLite FTS5 full-text search with dense vector embeddings for
  semantic similarity. Designed as persistent memory for LLM applications,
  YAMS features content-addressed storage with SHA-256 hashing, block-level
  deduplication via Rabin chunking, real-time incremental indexing, and
  ONNX-accelerated embeddings. The hybrid search mechanism achieves
  state-of-the-art retrieval quality on standard benchmarks while maintaining
  low latency for interactive use cases.
