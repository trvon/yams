# Pricing (Preview)

Preview pricing approach; details may change before beta/GA.

!!! note
    Status: Private preview. If you’d like to help us shape pricing and quotas, contact us to join early access.

## Principles

- Transparent and predictable
- Pay for what you use, with clear caps
- Generous free tier for development and small projects
- Easy to export your data at any time (no lock‑in)

---

## Tiers (evolving)

- Developer (Preview): Free during preview; caps for storage/requests/egress.
- Team (Beta): Usage‑based with caps; higher limits and basic support.
- Enterprise (GA): Contract pricing; SSO, audit logs, SLAs.

Exact limits and rates will be published before public beta.

## What we meter

We meter a small set of intuitive dimensions:

- Storage at rest (GB‑month)
- API requests and background jobs
- Egress bandwidth (GB)
- Optional: vector index operations (if materially different from standard requests)

During preview, we’ll validate these and publish concrete numbers.

---

## Preview allowances

- Developer (Preview): free within generous caps
- Hard caps to avoid surprise bills; credits or extended free usage for early adopters

Exact caps will be shared in your invite.

---

## Billing and invoicing

- Billing: Stripe.
- Invoices/receipts via Stripe.
- Usage dashboard with monthly breakdowns (beta).
- Payments: cards initially; invoices/P.O. for Enterprise at GA.
